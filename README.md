ðŸ“š Simple Books API
This is a small project that lets you manage a list of books. It's built with Node.js and a tool called Express. Think of it like a simple online service where you can:
Get all books
Get one specific book
Add new books
Change details of existing books
Delete books
The books are just stored in the computer's memory, so there's no fancy database needed. This is great for learning how basic web services work!
âœ¨ What It Does
Here's what you can do with this API:
Get all books: See every book you've added.
Get one book: Look up a book using its unique ID.
Add a new book: Send a new book's title and author.
Update a book: Change a book's title or author using its ID.
Delete a book: Remove a book using its ID.
ðŸ’» How to Get Started
Follow these steps to get this project running on your computer.
What you need:
Node.js: This is like the engine for our project.
npm: This comes with Node.js and helps install other tools.
Postman: A tool to test our API (like making requests to it).
Setup:
Create a folder for your project. Let's call it books-api.
Bash
mkdir books-api
cd books-api
Start a new Node.js project inside that folder:
npm init -y
Install the necessary tools:
npm install express uuid
Create a file named server.js in your books-api folder.
Copy and paste all the code from your server.js file into this new file.
Run the API:
Open your computer's terminal (or VS Code's terminal) in your books-api folder.
Start the server by typing:
node server.js
You'll see a message like Server running on http://localhost:3000. This means your API is ready!
ðŸš€ How to Use the API (with Postman)
Once the server is running, you can use Postman to send requests to your API. The API is running on http://localhost:3000.
